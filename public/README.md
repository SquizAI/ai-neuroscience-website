# Beyond Scaling: Why AI Needs Neuroscience to Achieve True Intelligence

This repository contains a comprehensive article and supporting materials examining the limitations of the scaling paradigm in AI development and proposing a neuroscience-informed approach to achieving artificial general intelligence.

## Contents

1. **[draft_doc.md](draft_doc.md)** - Main article draft exploring why scaling alone is insufficient for achieving AGI and how neuroscience principles offer essential guidance.

2. **[1_scaling_limitations.md](1_scaling_limitations.md)** - Detailed analysis of the limitations of the scaling paradigm, including theoretical foundations, physical constraints, and the unpredictability of emergent abilities.

3. **[2_neuroscience_principles.md](2_neuroscience_principles.md)** - In-depth exploration of key neuroscience principles including the Free Energy Principle, metastability, and embodied cognition, with implications for AI development.

4. **[3_consciousness_vs_intelligence.md](3_consciousness_vs_intelligence.md)** - Examination of the differences between intelligence and consciousness based on Anil Seth's work, explaining why AI may achieve intelligence without consciousness.

5. **[4_prediction_mechanisms.md](4_prediction_mechanisms.md)** - Comparison of prediction mechanisms in AI systems versus the brain, highlighting Luciano Floridi's critique of "agency without intelligence."

6. **[5_practical_recommendations.md](5_practical_recommendations.md)** - Concrete research directions and implementation strategies for incorporating neuroscience principles into AI development.

7. **[6_references_and_resources.md](6_references_and_resources.md)** - Comprehensive list of academic publications, books, researchers, and resources for further exploration.

## Key Arguments

This article collection argues that:

1. While scaling has led to impressive AI capabilities, it faces fundamental limitations as a path to AGI
2. Neuroscience principles offer complementary frameworks that address these limitations
3. The Free Energy Principle, metastability, and embodied cognition provide specific mechanisms missing in current AI
4. Consciousness and intelligence may be dissociable, with important implications for AI development
5. An integrated approach incorporating these principles offers a more promising path to genuine AI understanding
