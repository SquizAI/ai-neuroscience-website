# AI Neuroscience Concept Map

This interactive diagram illustrates the key relationships between artificial intelligence and neuroscience concepts discussed throughout this website. The map is organized into three main categories:

1. **Scaling Paradigm** (pink) - Concepts related to the current AI scaling approach and its limitations
2. **Neuroscience Insights** (teal) - Key neuroscience principles that could inform AI development
3. **Practical Applications** (gray) - Recommendations and directions for future research

## Key Relationships

- **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)** sits at the top, with two primary approaches: the scaling paradigm and neuroscience-informed development
- **Scaling Limitations** branch into theoretical constraints, practical issues, and emergent abilities
- **Neuroscience Insights** include the Free Energy Principle, metastability, embodied cognition, consciousness vs. intelligence distinctions, and prediction mechanisms
- **Practical Applications** emerge from the integration of these neuroscience principles

Explore each section of the website to learn more about these concepts in detail.
