# Limitations of Current Approaches

## The Scaling Paradox

While scaling has produced impressive results, it faces fundamental limitations that may prevent further progress toward artificial general intelligence.

## Computational Barriers

The computational requirements of large AI models are growing at an unsustainable rate:

- **Exponential Resource Growth**: Each doubling of performance requires much more than double the resources
- **Environmental Impact**: Training a single large language model can produce as much carbon as five cars over their lifetimes
- **Economic Constraints**: Only a handful of organizations can afford to train and run the largest models

**Example**: GPT-3 (175B parameters) required an estimated 1,287 MWh of electricity for training, while GPT-4 (estimated 1.7T parameters) likely required at least 10x more.

## Data Limitations

The scaling paradigm assumes unlimited high-quality data, but this assumption is increasingly problematic:

- **Data Exhaustion**: We're approaching the limits of high-quality text data available on the internet
- **Quality Issues**: As models consume more data, they increasingly encounter lower-quality or problematic content
- **Privacy Concerns**: Indiscriminate data collection raises serious ethical and legal questions

**Research Finding**: A 2023 study by researchers at MIT and Stanford found that the quality of training data has a much larger impact on model performance than simply increasing model size beyond a certain threshold.

## Diminishing Returns

Perhaps most concerning is the evidence of diminishing returns:

- **Benchmark Plateaus**: Performance improvements on many benchmarks are slowing despite massive increases in scale
- **Persistent Failure Modes**: Some types of reasoning errors persist regardless of scale
- **Efficiency Gap**: The gap between AI and human efficiency (in terms of data and compute required for learning) continues to widen

## Fundamental Architectural Limitations

Beyond practical constraints, there are theoretical reasons to believe the current architecture of deep learning systems may be fundamentally limited:

- **Lack of Causal Understanding**: Current models excel at correlation but struggle with causation
- **No Intrinsic Motivation**: Models lack internal drives that guide exploration and learning in biological systems
- **Missing Embodiment**: Without physical interaction with the world, certain types of understanding may be unattainable

## The Need for New Approaches

These limitations suggest that simply making models bigger is not a viable path to artificial general intelligence. Instead, we need to explore fundamentally different approaches that address these limitations.

In the next chapter, we'll examine how principles from neuroscience might offer alternative paths forward that overcome these scaling limitations.

**Key Takeaway**: While scaling has been remarkably successful, it faces both practical limitations (compute, data, economics) and fundamental architectural limitations that suggest we need to explore alternative approaches to AI development.
